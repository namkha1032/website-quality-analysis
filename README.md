# About the project
This project analyses the quality of a website based on its Exit Rate, Bounce Rate and Page Value. The programming language used is [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
- Page Value is the average value that the page contributes to our website's revenue
- An Exit occurs when a user exits your website after landing on a page
- A Bounce occurs whenever a user enters the page and subsequently exits without visiting any other pages on that website or interacting with any of the elements on the page (e.g. commenting)
# About the data
We use the dataset compiled by [Sakar, C.O., Polat, S.O., Katircioglu, M. et al. Neural Comput & Applic (2018)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). The dataset predicts the correlation between visitorâ€™s shopping intention and website abandonment likelihood, using variables like ExitRates, BounceRates and PageValues.
# Implementation progress
The progress will be conducted by the following 8 steps:
1. Sample the data. This step includes importing data, cleaning data and sampling data.
2. Compare the means of the data, using Boxplot and t-test.
3. Build the linear model, using R built-in command.
4. Test the linearity of the data, using Residuals vs Fitted plot.
5. Test the normality of the data, using Histogram, Density curve, QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk test.
6. Test the homoscedasticity of the data, using Scale-location plot and Breusch-Pagan test.
7. Test the independence of the data, using Durbin - Watson test.
8. Analyze the linear model, using R built-in command.

For all the tests, we will use the confidence interval of 95% which is assumed by RStudio program by default.
