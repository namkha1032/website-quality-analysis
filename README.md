# About the project
This project analyses the quality of a website based on its Exit Rate, Bounce Rate and Page Value. The programming language used is R.
- Page Value is the average value that the page contributes to our website's revenue
- An Exit occurs when a user exits your website after landing on a page
- A Bounce occurs whenever a user enters the page and subsequently exits without visiting any other pages on that website or interacting with any of the elements on the page (e.g. commenting)
## About the data
We use the dataset compiled by [Sakar, C.O., Polat, S.O., Katircioglu, M. et al. Neural Comput & Applic (2018)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). The dataset predicts the correlation between visitorâ€™s shopping intention and website abandonment likelihood, using variables like ExitRates, BounceRates and PageValues.
